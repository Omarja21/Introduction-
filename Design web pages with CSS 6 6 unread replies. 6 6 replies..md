## Hello my freind Odai,
### This is an introduction for the importance of color in web pages, the topic that you have asked me about a while ago, so I hope that you find these information as much as useful.
### The color subject is a very fun and easy to apply subject as long you can understand the different ways of presenting the colors which are:
* rgb values (Red, Green, Blue values)
* hex codes #code like #FFFFFF to present the white in the color palet
* color names like white, black, blue ...etc
### Contrast is also an important topic when introducing the web page especially When picking foreground and backgroundcolors, it is important to ensure that there isenough contrast for the text to be legible.Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors. Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors. For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability
#### **CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA. X CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.**
