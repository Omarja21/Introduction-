##how computer works, what makes a  computer a computer ?
it is breifly a machin that help people to acheive the thinking
work they do such as solving equations or tracking strs in the sky.
and it depends on 4 different tasks:
1. take input 
2. store information
3. process it 
4. making output 
and they the common thing between all different computers


Binary and data: 
In a breif way of explaining this topicevery thing you see, hear and read from the computers 
(output) can be breaken down into 0,1 so it works on the binary numbers system as an illustration for that it works with only (0,1) it has many positions the difference between each one is that the new position is multiplied by 2 
after the old position so the first position is represented by 1st position 2nd position 4th position 8th poision so the number 9 is 1(8*1) 0 0 1(1*1)=9, also for example the text can be divided into charachterers
(A, B, C..) each one of them has a number A=1 B=2 so every letter is given a value based on this logic also the pictures have pixels each pixel has a color and each color has a number and thats how the computer read the 
pictures in its form base.

Circuites and logic:
As we know that computer deals with the information with the binary system (1,0) so in order to process the information that comes as input to make it as output the computer need to modify and combine the input signals
so it uses a tiny electronic components which makes circuites 

Memory, Input & Output:
computer can recognize the input of the other devices by the binary system so for example if u pressed the letter "B" on your key board it will be converted into 0,1 and the CPU calculates how to display the letter B pixel by pixel 
by taking the orders from the memory of how to draw the letter B and runs the instructions and stores the resuls pixel by pixel in the memory finaly these binary information will be send to the screen to convert the binary
