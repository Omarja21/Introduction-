## Hello my freind Odai,
### This is an introduction of the actual action of how to start structuring a web page with HTML, the topic that you have asked me about a while ago, so I hope that you find these information as much as useful.
### As a beginning before the actual act of designing a website you should ask your-self some questions about your target audience like:
* Who is the site for?
* what is the underlying motivation for why visitors come to the site?
* What is the specific goals of the visitors?
*what information your visitors need? 

### After collecting the data you need to do the **site map** which is , *simply*, a diagram that will be used to structure the site it is more of a tree map, and then you need to do the **wirefram** which is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of the site.

### The final process that you need to pay attention to is that you need to get your message across the design by organizing and prioretizing information on page to help users to understand its importance.
