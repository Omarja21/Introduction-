### Grow means success and a better understanding of how everything works, also it means to be more productive which leads to feel better about yourself and in result for being more successful in life, and in this breif we'll compare between a fixed mindset, which means being more closed to the new ideas, and the growth mindset.
### Let us start with the fixed mindset, and by describing a person that he has a fixed miondset we mean that he is more of a surrender person than challenging for example if he faced a problem he will try to solve the problem in the same method many times, and for sure if it does not work in the first time it will not work in the second, so after the failing he will describe himself as an unsuccessful person and it will lead him by default to (*avoid the problemby giving up*), on the other hand the growth mindset will try to solve his problems a step by step and try other ways by being open to new suggestion whether from his colleauges or the experienced in the feild (*confront the challenge and being open for others solutions*).
### Now as we have known one of the differences between *fixed* and *growth* mindsets the other difference is how these two mindsets are looking for the successfull of others as the fixed mindset guy will be jealous as he is see it as a ***threat***, as the growth mindset person will enjoy the success of others and see it as ***inspiration***. 
### In the light of speaking about mindsets we need to quote from the great American philosopher Robert M. Pirsig who wrote about the ***Gumption Trap*** which is:
You know what you have to be done but lacking the motivation to do it.

### so the solution for that is to stand up and put everything in your hand and walk away and return when you feel that you feel more inspired, that helps you to have the peace with the idea that you are loosing focus and that is fine.
### The goal of being in a growth mindset is to open much possibilities, acheive more and set higher goals.
