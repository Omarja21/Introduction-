# Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
As you can edit 
1. Headers for example:

# h1 header in HTML

## h2 header in HTML

###### h6 header in HTML 

2. Emphasis such as **bold text**, *italic*, ~~stickthrough~~

3. * unordered Lists 
  * sublist 1
  * sublist 2 
 and also Ordered list such as 
 1. ordered list 
 2. ordered list 
    * unordered list in ordered list 1
    * unordered list in ordered list 2
    
4. Images like : [Image](https://www.iconsdb.com/icons/preview/soylent-red/code-optimization-2-xxl.png)

First header | Second header
