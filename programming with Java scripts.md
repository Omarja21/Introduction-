Java script allows the user to make a web pages more interactive by accessing and midifying the content 
and mark up used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser:

1-PROGRAM RULES
You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
• A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a form, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport). 

REACT TO EVENTS
You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:
• A button is pressed
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on
• A cursor hovers over an element
• Information is added to a form
• An interval of time has passed
• A web page has finished loading

1-What is a script and how do I creat one?

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
 
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the asks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
 
Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps so you need to:
1: DEFINE THE GOAL 
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3: CODE EACH STEP  

2- how do computer fits in with the world around them?
a script is just a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem in hand. This is why creating a script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a
computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time.

 So a program must give the computer enough detail to perform the task as if every time were its first time.
