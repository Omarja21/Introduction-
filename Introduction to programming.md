# Hello my freind Odai,
## This is an introduction of the actual action of how to start coding, the topic that you have asked me about a while ago, so I hope that you find these information as much as useful.
## First you need to know more about the tool you need to use in your coding journy which is, to be honest, more of a personal choice rathar than what is good and whatis not but you need to focus on 4 important things which are  code  completion which will save you alote of time, syntax highlighting which will help you to colorize text to make it more noticable, also you need to pay attention that it has a nice variety of themes for the safety of your eyes and make the job more comforatble,and last you need check if it has the ability a various group of extention because it will save your effort, time and it really give a magical toches to the projects sometimes.
## After choosing the right text editor you need to know more about the terminal/command line which is is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
## These are  a few commands and their functions:
1. pwd: to provide you with your current directory
2. cd: to change directory 
3. ls -l list long command: to give you more details about the files in the directory
4. ls -la list long all command: to givve you a detailed list of all the files in the directory including the hidden ones 
## At the end I want you to know that the linux OS deals with everything as a file, it has an extensionless system and it is case sensitive. 
### sincerely, Omar
