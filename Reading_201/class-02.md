### In this paragraph we are talking about the the structural markup of the web pages starting from the <h1></h1> tag which is 
used to identify the heading of the website, also the website can view the different headings is different sizes using the 
<h1>,<h2>,<h3>...<h6> tags based on the importance <h1> most important <h6> least important.

### After writing the heading you need to start writing your paragraph for the website, so you need to use the 
<p> "paragraph content" <p/> tag to identify that this text is a paragraph for the browser, and if you want to emphasis 
on of the words inside of a paragraph you can use whether a <b> Important word </b> tag to make it bold or you can use 
<i> italic text here </i> tag to make it italic. So the next step that you need is to seperat the lines(if needed) so you 
need to use the <br></br> tag to make a break between lines or the the <hr /> to draw line between written lines.

### After finish talking about the structural markup it is time now to talk about the sematic markup which means tags that do not 
effect the structure of the web page but add extra information starting with the <strong> tag that indicates that the text 
inside this tag has strong emphasis from the author (by default it will be shown in bold), likewise the <em> tag but htis one
will show it in italic by default. Another two semantical tags are used for quotation <q></q> for a line quotation
<blockquote></blockquote> for longer quotation that may exceed for one paragraph

### You can take this a futher step and do an abbriviation for a specific word such as pro and make tag
<p> <abbr title='professional'> pro</abbr> so when hover over it it will show the full abbriviation for it, that is on the 
word level but in the citation of others work level you can use the <cite> tag.

In this paragraph we will turn the lights on the java script, its main components and how to use them?

### First the java script is used to give the website functionality such as when you want to do a simple mathematical operation
to calculat the area value (area = height * width) for example in java script you need to give the hight and the width a value 
also tell the coputer to multiply them to get the area value and  at the end to return this value to the computer and this is 
how it works!

### There is three data types you can define in java script:
1- strings: they are consist of letters and any other charachter on the keyboard between 'this is string' and the browser is dealing 
with this data type as a text
2- numeric: this data type represent the numbers, this data type is used for calculations and counting operations 
3- boolean: this data type is whether one of to values true or false

### After illustrating the concept of how the computer manage to do a simple caculation and know what is the data types now we
need to know how store these data types to use them again:
### 1- you can store a number, string or boolean using a variable by using the let or var reserved word for exaple 
var username;
var message;
username = 'Omar';
message = 'You are a programmer';
var elName = document.getElementByld{'name');
elName .textContent = username;
var elNote = document .getElementByld( 'note');
elNote .textContent = message; 

###and in the HTML part you can use this tag including the source to link the java with the HTML:
<script src="js/string-width-quotes.js"></scri pt> 

### 2-also instead of storing one value, you can store a list of variables using the arrays for example: var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom'];
